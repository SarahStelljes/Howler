# Howler

## Description
The motivation to make Howler was to learn about NoSQL because even though MySQL is sorta fun, it takes a long time to plan, especially if it's a big database. One reason why I made Howler is because I wanted to use something similar for my own seperate website. The app itself doesn't solve any problems, but using MongoDB does solve the problem of lengthy planning and able to update the schema easily if desired. What I learned was how to use MongoDB, and even though it took a bit for me to get, it was fun to learn about and use!

## Installation
There's not much to the installation process. Just clone the project/download the zip file, and in your terminal, just type 'npm i' or 'npm install'.

## Usage
In order to use Howler, you will need to use Insomnia or a similar program.

## Credits
Other than the utils/dateFormat, everything was coded by me, Sarah Stelljes.
